[Suteki da ne]
Wind, and my heart swimming in collected words
Moved by the wind, in through the world.
Clouds, like a voice that we all recognize
Carry the holding future.

Moon, on the sky as a trembling heart
Shown on the glass unsteadily.
Stars, shedding tears in an overflowing stream
I see the night all around me.

Suteki da ne
Being together, all alone walking hand in hand.
And I want to go to your city
To your home, into your arms.

That soul
Inside your body
From those conflicted nights
As from my dreams.

Wind died away, and I feel all the words
Led by a gentle illusion.
Clouds are the future that cannot be attained
Told from impossible distance.

The moon filled with night as it flowed through your heart
Such faraway reflections.
Stars, ripe like tears, like fruit falls from a tree
I wipe my dreams off the nighttime.

Suteki da ne
Being together, all alone walking hand in hand.
And I want to go to your city
To your home, into your arms.

To feel your face
The touch of memory
And now that I awake
As from a dream.
