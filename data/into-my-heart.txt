You found me in a distant place far from you
It′s like you came from outer space out of the blue
Yeah I've been hoping and praying for someone to come along
And I′m so glad that it's your face that I'm staring into

Unexpected feelings come up
When you are around me
Who knew I deserved this much love
Your galaxy surrounds me
You are, you are aye
You are all that I′ve wished for
You are, you are aye

Oh, there are millions of stars honey
Oh, but you′re different yes you are
I thought that you were light years away yeah
I never thought that I'd see the day yeah
Oh, out of this world into my heart

When I can feel you touching me, it gives me the chills
And there is no gravity, the earth stands still
Don′t care if anyone's watching us while we dance in the sky
Cuz baby it′s just you and I
Its just you and I

When you are around me
The galaxy surrounds me

Oh, there are millions of stars honey
Oh, but you′re different yes you are
I thought that you were light years away yeah
I never thought that I'd see the day yeah
Oh, out of this world into my heart
